I started OnYourRank with a clear mission — democratize quality education using cutting-edge AI. In India, access to good coaching is still a privilege. I believed that AI-powered personalization, RAG-based doubt resolution, and intelligent content delivery could bridge that gap at scale.

We built real technology — a multi-agent RAG system handling 100K+ queries, full-stack platform with Angular and FastAPI, comprehensive content for PM interviews and competitive exams. Early users loved the product. Engagement metrics were strong. We were solving a real problem.


- **Distribution is expensive in EdTech.** Acquiring students in a market flooded with free YouTube content and VC-funded competitors offering heavy discounts meant our CAC was unsustainable. We were competing against companies burning crores on marketing.

- **Timing and trust.** EdTech post-2022 faced a credibility crisis (BYJU'S, layoffs, shutdowns). Students and parents became skeptical of new platforms. Building trust as a bootstrapped newcomer was an uphill battle.

- **AI wasn't the moat we thought it was.** Everyone started adding "AI features." Our technical differentiation became harder to communicate to a non-technical audience.


- **Willingness to pay is low.** Indian students expect free or near-free content. Converting free users to paid was brutal — sub-2% conversion despite strong engagement.

- **B2B was slow.** We explored selling to coaching institutes, but sales cycles were 6+ months, and decision-makers weren't tech-forward.

- **Unit economics never worked.** Content creation, infrastructure, and support costs outpaced revenue. Without external funding, we couldn't survive the long runway EdTech requires.

## The Decision

After months of trying different pivots — niche verticals, B2B, freemium models — we had to be honest with ourselves. The path to profitability wasn't visible, and continuing without conviction wasn't fair to ourselves or our users.
