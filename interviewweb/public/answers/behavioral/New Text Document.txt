I started OnYourRank to democratize education using AI — built a full-stack platform with RAG-based doubt resolution, multi-agent systems, and personalized learning for competitive exam aspirants.
What Worked
The product. Strong engagement, users loved the AI-powered experience, and we processed 100K+ queries through our pipeline.
What Didn't

Distribution — Competing against VC-funded players burning crores on marketing with a bootstrapped budget was brutal.
Monetization — Indian students expect free content. Conversion rates stayed below 2%, and B2B sales cycles were too slow.
Timing — Post-2022 EdTech trust crisis made users skeptical of new platforms.

We're now winding down.
What I Learned
Great technology isn't enough — distribution and unit economics matter just as much. I also learned when to persist versus when to be honest with yourself. The failure taught me more about building products than any success could have.
I don't regret it. I shipped real AI systems end-to-end, and I'm a sharper product leader because of it.
